**\# What Should We Remember?**

When humans problem solve, begin a logical reasoning or complex problem solving assignment we are faced with the question, “What Should We Remember?”, based on limitations to our brain processing power.

\#\# Human Information Processing Tendencies Regarding What We Tend To Remember

\#\#\# We edit and reinforce some memories after the fact

\#\#\#\# Misattribution of memory bias

The misattribution of memory, also known as source misattribution, refers to the incorrect identification of the origin of a memory by the person recalling it. This type of misattribution often occurs when individuals are unable to monitor and control how their attitudes influence their judgments during the process of memory retrieval​

\#\#\#\# Source confusion

Source confusion, also termed source misattribution, refers to errors in memory where the specific source of a piece of information or memory is mistakenly attributed to an incorrect source. This type of memory error happens when the details related to the source of the memory do not get properly encoded at the time the memory is formed, or when source aspects fade from the memory over time. As a result, the original source becomes confused with other sources during attempted recall. Source confusion demonstrates issues with accurately binding source details in human memory processes. It can lead to the formation of false memories, where imagined or unreliable details are attached to memories through source errors.

\#\#\#\# Cryptomnesia

Cryptomnesia occurs when a forgotten memory returns to a person's awareness, but the person mistakenly believes they are generating a new thought or idea. The concept is related to inadvertent plagiarism, as it involves expressing an idea or memory without realizing it is not novel. In cryptomnesia, previous memories of songs, poems, stories, or other content are retrieved from memory storage and brought back into consciousness, but the source of the memory is forgotten or confused. The person then assumes the thought represents their own imagination rather than a replicated memory. Cryptomnesia demonstrates how memories can become disconnected from their sources and how people may come to believe recalled ideas are original to them rather than ultimate originating elsewhere. Identifying cryptomnesia can be complex, as the plagiarized memory feels subjectively real and the cryptomnesic person is convinced they created it.

\#\#\#\# False memory

A false memory refers to recalling an event or details that did not actually occur. False memories can be very vivid and held with high confidence, even though the remembered events deviate from reality or contain elements of fiction. These types of illusory memories highlight flaws in human memory processes \- rather than perfectly preserving all details like a video recorder, memory is constructive and prone to errors. False memories frequently form when current stimuli or contexts invoke related memories which then get altered or expanded based on persistent activation of those memory traces. Things like leading interview questions, doctored images, or suggestions may trigger the formation of false memories from existing semantic knowledge. Once formed, false memories tend to solidify over time and can be nearly impossible to disentangle from factual accounts. This illustrates the malleable and subjective nature of human memory recollection.

\#\#\#\# Suggestibility

Suggestibility bias refers to the tendency for people's memories, perceptions, and behaviors to be altered by suggestion from external influences. It demonstrates that human cognition is vulnerable to having subjectivity shaped by implied expectations or guidance. In suggestibility bias, leading questions, pressure to conform, authority figures, stereotypes, or assumptions sway people to form memories or beliefs consistent with the suggestions. For example, eyewitnesses to a crime can come to remember details falsely if interviewers ask leading questions that incorporate misinformation. People also routinely misattribute the source of memories in line with suggestions, showing memory attribution errors. Suggestibility effects persist due to confirmation bias, in which people preferentially notice and give more credence to details that match the suggestion or expectation. Safeguarding against suggestibility requires conscious critical evaluation of subjective experience for potential suggestion effects. Careful consideration of the reliability of sources is also key to mitigating suggestibility.

\#\#\#\# Spacing effect

The spacing effect refers to the finding that memory recall is stronger when learning events are spaced out over time rather than massed together. This memory advantage for spaced exposure demonstrates that distributing repetitions aids long-term retention. Research shows both longer spaces between learning sessions and varying the contexts of the sessions improves retention compared to massed learning in a single context. The spacing effect points to failures in human memory consolidation \- cramming information produces rapid short-term learning but poorer eventual recall. Optimal memory consolidation requires time for neural strengthening processes and associations to solidify. Spreading out learning sessions also takes advantage of mental retrieval training each time content is revisited. The spacing effect is key for efficient studying; flashcards, practice tests, and periodic review are helpful techniques. Implementation of spaced learning has yielded performance gains in domains like athletics, music skills, and student test scores.

\#\#\# We discard specifics to form generalities

\#\#\#\# Implicit associations

Implicit associations refer to unconscious links in memory between mental representations of concepts, often formed through classical or operant conditioning. For example, repeatedly experiencing two stimuli together like brand logos and jingles forges associative bounds between their neural memory traces. Later encounters with one facet more easily reactivate the associated representation even without awareness or intent. Implicit biases similarly emerge from accrued associative linkages that automatically shape impressions and evaluations. Building new incongruent associations requires conscious effort and repetition to establish alternative pathways that can override implicitly embedded links. Dismantling the unconscious roots of prejudice and superstition relies on supplanting worn associative grooves with ethical principles through vigilant training. Implicit memory associations represent ingrained mental shortcuts based on correlational encoding across experiences that surrender accuracy for speed and cognitive ease. Because the unconscious comfortably perpetuates connections free from scrutiny, implicit memory networks promote rigid assumptions resistant to cognitive overrides without deliberate intervention.

\#\#\#\# Implicit stereotypes

The human tendency toward in-group preference and out-group prejudice has deep evolutionary roots. However, implicit biases based on gender, ethnicity, orientation and other traits reflect socially-conditioned associative memories rather than intrinsic absolutes. Culture and experience shape the accrual of implicit associations that automatically link groups to judgments without conscious intent. Once formed, these implicit stereotyping biases powerfully influence evaluations and behaviors unless actively questioned and counter-conditioned through vigilant self-awareness. Dismantling prejudice requires overriding deeply-worn implicit biases by consciously building new associations that promote fairness, empathy and social justice. We must recognize that no one is immune to implicit bias absorption from broader cultures. But each of us holds responsibility for monitoring our own implicit memories to ensure expressions align with ethical principles rather than outdated norms.

\#\#\#\# Prejudice

Prejudice can be an affective feeling towards a person based on their perceived group membership. The word is often used to refer to a preconceived (usually unfavorable) evaluation or classification of another person based on that person's perceived personal characteristics, such as political affiliation, sex, gender, gender identity, beliefs, values, social class, age, disability, religion, sexuality, race, ethnicity, language, nationality, culture, complexion, beauty, height, body weight, occupation, wealth, education, criminality, sport-team affiliation, music tastes or other perceived characteristics. People prefer to make predictions about things in a category based on prior experience with that category, with the resulting predictions occasionally being accurate (though not always) based on the person’s actual lived experience. Some researchers argue that this process of categorisation and prediction is necessary for survival and social interaction.

\#\#\#\# Negativity bias

The negativity bias refers to the human tendency to give more weight to negative experiences and information compared to positive ones. Across many studies, people have been shown to react more strongly, pay more attention, and give higher priority to negatives such as threats, losses, harm, or bad news. This bias likely emerged evolutionarily because focusing on potential threats aided human survival more than positive things. But it continues to shape many aspects of cognition. For example, negative events are more quickly noticed, produce longer-lasting memories, and lead to stronger emotional reactions. The negativity bias illustrates how human psychology favors “bad is stronger than good” in processing information. Challenging this requires actively working to rebalance perceptions since negative inputs so easily dominate processing allocation and reactions. But cultivating positivity-offsetting practices can lead to important well-being benefits.

\#\#\#\# Fading affect bias

The fading affect bias refers to how the emotional intensity of autobiographical memories tends to fade more quickly over time for positive events compared to negative events. People generally recall positive experiences from their past with less intense feelings and vivid details compared to negative experiences, which remain powerfully charged in memory. For example, weddings and graduations become less emotionally evocative over the years whereas traumatic events maintain their psychological potency decades later. This asymmetry occurs because negative emotional memories are encoded deeper in the brain, tap into survival circuits, and undergo greater rehearsal through rumination cycles that strengthen them. Positive events evoke less robust consolidation mechanisms, making them more ephemeral. The fading affect bias shows how emotion and personal significance shape recall vividness \- not objective factual qualities of past events. It takes effort to sustain positive memories as neural responsiveness habituates. But reinforcing joyful recollections is important for well-being and resilience.

\#\#\# We reduce events and lists to their key elements

\#\#\#\# Peak-end rule

The peak-end rule describes how memories of experiences are disproportionately shaped by their most intense points and their endings rather than a balanced integration. Rather than accurately averaging all moments, our memories tend to be defined by peak emotional events and final impressions. This causes duration neglect \- short but dramatic experiences may be remembered as more significant than long, mild ones if intensity peaks are higher. The peak-end bias is thought to result from memory consolidation processes that privilege salient, valence-loaded instances. End moments also receive heightened focus as the final meaningful inputs during an experience. The peak-end rule explains phenomena like differences between real-time reported pain and recalled pain, or why a fantastic meal can be rated poorly if it ends on a bad note. It reveals the selectivity of memory formation \- the essence of episodes become reduced down to highly emotional, recent occurrences that may not encapsulate the whole. Our memories extract symbolic meaning rather than comprehensive documentation.

\#\#\#\# Leveling and sharpening

The leveling and sharpening effect refers to distortions in memory where some aspects become normalized while others are exaggerated. Certain details fade or regress toward averages during memory consolidation, while other salient or meaningful pieces become more pronounced and intense over time. For example, in remembering facial features, small or unusual details get leveled out in favor of typical elements, while significant traits like scarcity or expressiveness are sharpened. Similar effects occur when remembering past performances, relationships, or experiences \- idiosyncrasies level out but peak features sharpen. Neural consolidation processes likely underpin this effect by strengthening synaptic connectivity for significant signals while weak links to minor details atrophy. The leveling and sharpening bias reveals how memory recollection moves toward abstraction by enhancing extraordinary details against a backdrop of typical generalized features. What results is a subjectively enhanced but factually unreliable representation built upon peaks, averages, and interpretations rather than faithful recordings. The phenomenon demonstrates the reconstructive nature of episodic memory retrieval.

\#\#\#\# Misinformation effect

The misinformation effect refers to the finding that exposure to incorrect post-event information can contaminate the memory of an original event. People can incorporate misleading suggestions about details into their recollection of actual memories, resulting in memory distortion. For example, if a witness to a car accident is later exposed to erroneous information about the speed of the cars, their eyewitness testimony can shift to align with the misinformation. The error persists because the misinformation impairs people's abilities to discriminate between the source of their original memory and the erroneous suggestions. The misinformation effect powerfully demonstrates the malleability of human memory. Rather than perfectly preserving original memory details, new competing inputs get integrated with old memories in flawed ways at both the encoding and retrieval stages. The distortions result from inability to suppress the erroneous memory trace in favor of the veridical one. Once formed, false memories can be stronger than true memories. Safeguarding against misinformation requires vigilance over sources along with metacognitive monitoring during retrieval attempts.

\#\#\#\# Serial recall effect

The serial recall effect refers to improved memory for items presented in a sequenced order rather than randomly. When trying to remember a list of items like words, numbers, or letters, they are more accurately recalled if originally presented in a meaningful sequential order. Semantic organization of items into a logical progression aids encoding into memory by providing structure and a narrative for the information. Retrieval is also improved with serial order information that allows each item to cue recall of the next one. However, smoothly ordered sequences can also introduce memory errors through intrusions or anticipations of related items expected in the progression. The serial recall effect reveals key differences between organized episodic memory linked to sequencing versus more random semantic memory storage. Learning information in associated chunks centered on storylines or ordered ideas boosts recollection, though some loss of specifics still occurs. This explains common study interventions like mnemonic devices that reorder data for easier retention through imposition of order rather than rote memorization.

\#\#\#\# List-length effect

The list-length effect refers to the phenomenon where people's ability to recall items from memory diminishes as the number of items increases. As more words, numbers, names, etc. get added to a list we try to store in memory, the probability of forgetting or confusing some portion grows, illustrating capacity limits in working memory. Recall performance declines steadily as list length grows past 4-5 items for most people. However, closed-set categories (like letter recall) allow for longer span retention compared to arbitrary open-set lists (like random nouns). List-length effects reflect core information processing limits in components of short-term memory needed for transient binding of details during encoding and retrieval. Longer lists exceed these system capacities, preventing formation of durable memory traces. Similar list-length effects have been noted in other aspects of cognition like reasoning spans. The list-length effect reveals quantifiable constraints on human mental bandwidth \- while memory and intelligence depend on iterative mental processing, overload inevitably induces failures. Offloading information storage via external aids is an adaptation that helps us overcome strict mental list-length limits.

\#\#\#\# Duration neglect

Duration neglect refers to the common bias where one's judgment of an experience disproportionately depends on the most intense aspects and ending impressions rather than the total time duration. For example, a 20 minute pleasant walk can seem more satisfying than a 60 minute walk with 59 minutes of moderate enjoyment and 1 unpleasant minute at the end. The duration effect occurs because memory formation prioritizes peak emotional events and final moments over total duration tallies. From an information processing view, the most intense signals dominate mental bandwidth while time durations fail to leave salient memory traces. The duration neglect bias reveals how subjective memory differs from objective reality \- we remember in snapshots of peak meaning rather than integrated timespans. Our mental representations of episodes become simplified heuristics extracted from key events. While this allows efficient storage, it risks forming false impressions. Accurately assessing durations requires purposeful monitoring as events unfold rather than intuitive recollection afterwards. Just as we can't accurately guess time durations in the absence of clocks, our minds do not include reliable internal duration trackers.

\#\#\#\# Modality effect

The modality effect refers to the finding that memory recall is superior for information presented in a visual format compared to verbal information presented only in an auditory format. For example, people typically exhibit better memory for images, maps, diagrams and video content compared to orally presented descriptions. This benefit is thought to occur because rich visual inputs activate additional neural regions involved in perceptual processing and spatial relationships, providing more pathways for memory encoding. However, the modality advantage disappears when verbal materials can be visualized. This highlights the importance of dual coding \- linking verbal concepts to visual or spatial representations enables enhanced context and neural activations that aid memorization. The modality effect has key implications for communicating information intended for retention, such as in educational settings. Demonstrations, diagrams, and interactive elements can boost memory-building when coupled with oral or textual materials. However, visualization strategies remain essential for cementing memory traces even for spoken words alone. We encode words in working memory on a deeper level when they invoke mental imagery to accompany verbal inputs.

\#\#\#\# Memory inhibition

Memory inhibition refers to the active suppression of irrelevant or outdated memories to avoid interference with retrieval of current task-relevant information. It demonstrates that forgetting is not just a failure to consolidate memories, but also a directed function enabling adaptive, focused cognitive processing. Inhibition acts to clear working memory when no longer needed information could potentially cause proactive interference in new learning. Intentional suppression of memories has been shown to make them less recallable over time as self-directed inhibition signals strengthen. However, inhibited memories can resurface later if inhibiting cues are removed. Inhibition is thus an active tuning process where the brain prunes accessibility to memories based on shifting needs. Breakdowns in inhibition are apparent in intrusive thoughts or rumination patterns where irrelevant memories intrude repeatedly. Controlled memory inhibition serves an executive function role in constraining recall to presently pertinent information. Just as focused attention promotes specific sensory detail processing, inhibition of secondary memories aids concentration by clearing out neural noise from alternative signals. The ability to intentionally dampen recall demonstrates the dynamic filter processes governing availability of memory content.

\#\#\#\# Primacy effect

The primacy effect refers to a memory advantage for information that is presented first in a sequence. In remembering a list like a shopping list or a string of facts, the first few items have a recall benefit relative to items in the middle. This advantage for early list chunks occurs because initial items can be rehearsed more frequently in working memory as the list lengthens. Initial items are also retrieved more often for comparisons as the list builds. Encoding of later list items has more interference as working memory load increases. The primacy effect demonstrates that equal memory storage across inputs cannot be assumed \- certain positional advantages lend increased opportunity for memory consolidation through active maintenance rehearsal, integration with existing knowledge, and frequent retrieval practice. However, the effect has key implications for persuasion tactics and impression formation as well. First impressions carry outsized influence, while latter inputs receive diminished scrutiny through cognitive saturation or fatigue. Guarding against primacy bias requires purposeful attentiveness to later inputs rather than reliance on untrustworthy intuitive judgments.

\#\#\#\# Recency effect

The recency effect refers to superior memory for information presented most recently during a series or sequence. When trying to recall a list of items just viewed, the last few are advantageously recalled better than the middle entries. This occurs because the short-term memory representations of recent items are most actively held in working memory networks, elevating accessibility. Neural firing patterns backing active short-term memories are more easily reactivated for final list items. However, the recency benefit is vulnerable to interference effects and lasts only minutes before recall reverts back primacy effects. The recency premium reveals the fleeting nature of working memory networks that temporarily maintain focal information. Without rehearsal into long term storage, short-term memory traces quickly turn over. Yet the recency effect has vital impacts in decision making \- in choosing between options, the most recent inputs hold greatest sway. This helps explain persuasion recency effects. While temporary, the recency bias demonstrates the limiting capacity to concurrently hold decision criteria in mind, biasing choices to presently foremost options.

\#\#\#\# Part-list cueing effect

The part-list cueing effect refers to the finding that memory for a list of items, like a shopping list, becomes impaired if some but not all items are used as reminder cues. Counterintuitively, providing partial list cues that objectively reduce the target recall load nevertheless harms overall memory performance. For example, being reminded of milk, eggs, and cereal when trying to remember a 10-item grocery list reduces the remaining uncued items successfully recalled. This occurs because selective cuing directs memory retrieval processes only to the related list segment rather than diffusely over the entire memory trace. Successful recall relies on reconstructive spreading activation that the cues overly constrain. Given an incomplete initiation cue, memory retrieval then fails. The part-list effect powerfully demonstrates that selective, graded cues can hurt recall performance. Providing cues intended to spark memory reconstruction can backfire by narrowing requisite search dynamics.

\#\#\#\# Serial position effect

The serial position effect refers to the pattern where memory for items in a sequence depends on whether they were presented early, in the middle, or late in the series. Items early in a presented list (the primacy region) as well as items late in the list (the recency region) are better recalled compared to items in the middle. Primacy effects result from increased rehearsal and establishment of those items in long-term memory, while recency effects emerge from short-term memory traces. The diminished memory for middle items reflects capacity limits of working memory \- early items propagate to long-term stores while later items are still actively held, but intermediate items lack such differential consolidation. The serial position curve demonstrates that the probability of successful recall varies systematically based on sequential order. This challenges assumptions that all presented memories have equal storage fate \- their initial temporal contexts meaningfully shape retention probability. Serial order effects signify the coordination of different memory processes based on sequencing and highlight why certain positional instances reliably foster enhanced embedding within our mental archives.

\#\#\#\# Suffix effect

The suffix effect refers to improved recall for an item when a novel suffix is appended during the encoding phase compared to no suffix. For example, attaching nonsensical syllables to words aids later retrieval even though the core word remains identical. The suffix alteration from encoding to retrieval provides a distinctiveness cue that enhances contextual details for search processes to converge on the target trace. The suffix effect epitomizes the depth of processing principle \- stronger memory encoding occurs when additional novel features are added to engage more elaborate perceptual processing rather than relying on pre-existing representations. The effect also demonstrates why memory retrieval fails \- successful recall requires sufficient cues to recreate enough activations to reinstate context. Impoverished cues merely invoke entrenched templates rather than distinctive instances. Counterintuitively, distorting studied information with suffixes implants fresh distinctive markers that the search process can later capitalize on to resurrect the associated target memory. The suffix boost for cued recall illustrates the reciprocal interplay in memory between reconstructive encoding and regenerative retrieval.

\#\#\# We store memories differently based on how they were experienced

\#\#\#\# Levels of processing effects

Memory retention differs based on the depth of cognitive processing devoted to information during encoding. "Shallow" processing related only to perceptual features like font styles fail to support durable memory storage. In contrast, "deep" semantic processing binding meaning to inputs yields robust consolidations. For example, deciding if words fit logical sentences produces better subsequent recall than counting syllables does. Multi-sensory elaboration strengthens traces further through additional neural pathway activation. The levels of processing effect reveals that brains do not uniformly record inputs \- attention and meaningfulness dictate memory fate. Information gleaned only from passive sensations tends to wash away while details scrutinized for coherence-building significance permeate neural networks as reinforced schemas. Therefore, memory is an inherently lossy reconstructive process rather than an indifferent accumulative function. Durable retention requires encoding inputs in relation to prior knowledge structures to induce widespread neural plasticity cascades consolidating traces across linked networks. Shallow sensory recordings alone fail to trigger adequate neural communication for strong memory formation.

\#\#\#\# Absent-mindedness

Absent-mindedness refers to lapses in memory or attention that lead to behaviors like misplacing items or forgetting intentions. It often stems from failures in prospective memory \- the system responsible for planned actions and future intentions. Rather than issues with retention per se, absent-mindedness represents executive function problems with adequately forming, activating, and monitoring intended tasks. Everyday memory errors like forgetting appointments or losing car keys illustrate prospective memory breakdowns where plans inaccurately get encoded or retrieval cues fail to trigger the associated intention. Absent-minded behaviors also emerge when attention gets overly focused on certain tasks while background intentions become neglected, or when alternating between multiple competing tasks. The mind slips into running on habit pathways rather than actively surveilling prospective plans requiring explicit cue checking. Habituated routines prove more automatic but prone to unintended omissions when control processes falter. Absent-minded memory glitches thereby signify monitoring deficiencies combined with reliance on implicit cues rather than consciously managed prospective control.

\#\#\#\# Testing effect

The testing effect refers to the finding that long-term memory is enhanced for information that has been subjected to active recall testing during learning compared to restudying that information. For example, practicing free recall strengthens memorization more than repeated reading. Attempting to retrieve items from memory cements knowledge because it triggers elaborative rehearsal and forges additional retrieval routes. The effort of reconstructing memories from cues also aids subsequent access by establishing links between related neural networks. Interpolated testing guides effective encoding strategies and draws attention to information gaps. The testing effect illustrates the inadequacy of repetitive review alone for producing durable memories \- the reconstructive process of retrieval strengthens consolidation. Testing primes knowledge for flexible application rather than inert representations through spreading activation. Given limited study time, testing outperforms restudying likely because of shifts from passive to engaged processing. Attempted recall provides essential feedback, bolsters future access pathways, and embeds understanding on a deeper level compared to mere information exposure.

\#\#\#\# Next-in-line effect

The next-in-line effect refers to the finding that when trying to recall items in a list, people tend to erroneously substitute recall of items that were presented next in the original list rather than the correct item. For example, when trying to remember the word "lake" from a list, people frequently incorrectly guess the word "boat" because that came next in the original sequence. This demonstrates that sequential order information gets encoded along with list items and later intrudes to produce ordering errors during attempted recall. The next-in-line intrusions reveal the reconstructive nature of memory \- the temporal context of a list produces strong associative cues based on contiguity. When target recall fails, the sequentially associated pieces tend to fill the void instead. Yet false memory intrusions persist due to failure of source monitoring \- people cannot accurately distinguish correct list items from those merely related or next in order. The next-in-line effect shows how false memories seamlessly emerge from associative cuing gone awry combined with muddy source attribution. It highlights susceptibility to memory conjuring rather than perfect reproduction.

\#\#\#\# Google effect

The Google effect refers to the finding that people's memory and knowledge retention for factual information declines given the prevalent reliance on search engines to readily access external data. When information feels highly accessible online, less effort gets devoted to internalizing details and encoding memory traces. Easy online lookups facilitate shallow processing without meaningful mental organizational effort. Similar trends have been noted with increased dependency on navigation apps, calculators, phone numbers lists and other digital access aids that reduce demands for fact memorization. Outsourced memory storage complements limited biological retention capacities, but likely worsens recall abilities through underuse. Passive re-exposure cannot substitute for elaborative rehearsal. While online searching promotes productivity, overdependence enables avoidance of deeper learning processes that support contextual insights. However, directives to purposefully learn the "hard way" without digital aids can overcome passive learning ruts. The Google effect signifies modern shifts toward collaborative intelligence distributed across internal and external knowledge traces, provided internal consolidation keeps pace.

\#\#\#\# Tip of the tongue effect

The tip-of-the-tongue state refers to the common experience of failing to produce a word or name that feels imminent, even though all related details can be recalled clearly. This temporary inaccessibility of stored memory demonstrates dissociations between intact semantic knowledge and deficits in phonological labels to activate speech output. The sense that the word is right there signifies networked access to the concept, but executive retrieval processes cannot secure the precise lexical tag to drive expression. Though intensely frustrating, the tip-of-the-tongue limbo reveals the constructive nature of memory \- activating associated information helps scaffold search trajectories toward eventual target convergence. The phenomenology tracks partial reconstruction from cascading network ignition that ultimately ignites the missing tag through tangential excitation buildup. Resolving the tip-of-the-tongue block is typically rapid once initial phonemes trigger the dormant pattern downstream. The fleeting yet salient experience is a microcosm of the dynamic interplay between memory network reconstruction and incremental output generation.
