**\# Too Much Information**

When humans problem solve, begin a logical reasoning or complex problem solving assignment we are faced with the situation of having, “Too Much Information”, based on limitations to our brain processing power.

\#\# Human Information Processing Tendencies Regarding Too Much Information or Sensory Overload

\#\#\# We notice things already primed in memory or repeated often

\#\#\#\# Availability heuristic

The availability heuristic is a mental shortcut used in decision-making and probability judgment. It relies on immediate examples that come to mind when evaluating a specific topic, concept, method, or decision. This heuristic can lead to errors, as people might overestimate the likelihood of events that are more recent, emotionally charged, or easier to remember. For instance, people might overestimate the frequency of events that receive extensive media coverage or are personally memorable, despite statistical evidence to the contrary.

\#\#\#\# Attentional bias

Attentional bias refers to how a person's perception is affected by selective factors in their attention. It may cause an individual to overlook alternative possibilities when focused on an existing train of thought. Attentional biases are often linked to clinically relevant symptoms such as anxiety and depression. For instance, cigarette smokers show an attentional bias for smoking-related cues, due to their brain's altered reward sensitivity.

\#\#\#\# Illusory truth effect

The illusory truth effect is the tendency to believe false information to be correct after repeated exposure. It occurs when repeated statements are more easily processed, leading people to believe they are more truthful. This effect can influence people even when they know the correct answer but are swayed by the repetition of a falsehood. It plays a significant role in fields like advertising, news media, and political propaganda​.

\#\#\#\# Mere exposure effect

The mere-exposure effect is a psychological phenomenon where people tend to develop a liking for things merely because they are familiar with them. This effect, sometimes called the familiarity principle, has been demonstrated with various stimuli including words, Chinese characters, paintings, pictures of faces, geometric figures, and sounds. It suggests that repeated exposure to a stimulus increases liking for it. The effect is robust and has been studied across different contexts and applications, including advertising and social psychology.

\#\#\#\# Context effect

A context effect in cognitive psychology describes the influence of environmental factors on one's perception of a stimulus. It involves the use of both sensory data and prior knowledge in the analysis of stimuli. Context effects can impact various aspects of daily life, including word recognition, memory, consumer decisions, and perception of artwork. The phenomenon shows that our understanding and interpretation of information can be significantly altered by the context in which stimuli are perceived.

\#\#\#\# Cue dependent forgetting

Cue-dependent forgetting, also known as retrieval failure, is the inability to recall information without memory cues. This phenomenon includes semantic cues (related to the meaning of information), state-dependent cues (related to the state of mind during learning), and context-dependent cues (related to the environment where learning occurred). For example, information learned while underwater is better recalled in the same environment. Cue-dependent forgetting illustrates how memory retrieval can be influenced by various factors, and not necessarily due to the loss of memory itself.

\#\#\#\# Mood-congruent memory bias

Mood-congruent memory bias is a phenomenon where an individual's current mood affects the kind of memories they recall. For example, when a person is happy, they are more likely to recall positive memories, and when sad, more likely to recall negative memories. This bias is explained through theories like Gordon Bower's associative network theory of feeling effects and the theory of emotional valence. It demonstrates how emotions are connected to memory and how mood can influence the recall of congruent autobiographical events or experiences.

\#\#\#\# Frequency illusion

The frequency illusion, also known as the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon, occurs when a person notices something for the first time and then starts seeing it everywhere. This illusion happens not because these things suddenly appear more frequently, but because the person's awareness of them has increased. It's a type of cognitive bias related to selective attention. Once something has been noticed, the brain subconsciously keeps an eye out for it, leading to an increased perception of its frequency.

\#\#\#\# Baader–Meinhof Phenomenon

The Baader-Meinhof Phenomenon, also known as the frequency illusion, occurs when something a person recently learned about or noticed appears to crop up everywhere. This heightened awareness is due to the brain's natural tendency for pattern recognition and selective attention. The phenomenon doesn't mean these items or topics are appearing more frequently; it's simply that the person is more attuned to noticing them. This cognitive bias highlights how our perception of reality can be influenced by recent exposures or experiences​.

\#\#\#\# Empathy gap

The empathy gap refers to a situation where people underestimate the influence of emotional or physical states on their own or others' behavior and decisions. This gap can occur in two forms: the "hot-cold empathy gap," where someone in a cold (emotionally neutral) state cannot accurately predict their own or others' choices or reactions in a hot (emotional or physically aroused) state, and vice versa; and the "interpersonal empathy gap," where individuals fail to understand others' feelings accurately. The empathy gap can lead to misunderstandings in personal relationships and poor decision-making.

\#\#\#\# Omission bias

The omission bias is a cognitive bias where people judge harmful actions as worse, or less moral, than equally harmful inactions (omissions). It's the tendency to favor an act of omission over one of commission, even if the outcome is the same or worse. This bias can affect various decisions, from personal judgments to public policy, where people may prefer to avoid action even when doing so results in negative consequences.

\#\#\# Bizarre, funny, visually-striking, or anthropomorphic things stick out more than non-bizarre/unfunny things

\#\#\#\# Bizarreness effect

The bizarreness effect is a psychological phenomenon where bizarre or unusual material is more easily remembered than common material. This effect occurs because unusual information stands out more and is therefore more memorable. However, research has shown that this effect is not always consistent and can depend on various factors, such as the context in which the information is presented and how it is processed by the individual. Essentially, the distinctiveness of bizarre information can enhance recall, but this is not a universal rule and can vary depending on specific situations and types of memory tasks.

\#\#\#\# Humor effect

The humor effect is a psychological phenomenon where people tend to remember humorous items more easily than non-humorous ones. This effect occurs because humor can capture attention, increase engagement, and boost memory retention. Humor activates brain regions associated with pleasure and reward, which in turn aids in the encoding and recall of information. This effect has implications in various fields, including education and advertising, where incorporating humor can enhance the retention and impact of the presented information.

\#\#\#\# Von Restorff effect

The Von Restorff effect, also known as the isolation effect, is a psychological phenomenon where an item that stands out from the rest is more likely to be remembered than other items. Named after the psychiatrist Hedwig von Restorff who identified it in 1933, this effect suggests that when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is more likely to be recalled. The distinctiveness of the item increases its salience and makes it more memorable. This effect is utilized in various fields, such as advertising and education, to highlight important information.

\#\#\#\# Picture superiority effect

The picture superiority effect is a psychological phenomenon where people tend to remember images more easily and accurately than words. This effect occurs because images are more likely to be encoded into long-term memory, enhancing recall. Pictures tend to be more concrete and can be processed more quickly and deeply than words, which often require more cognitive effort to encode. This effect is leveraged in various domains, such as advertising and education, to improve the retention and impact of information.

\#\#\#\# Self-relevance effect

The self-relevance effect is a cognitive bias where individuals are more likely to remember information that is personally relevant or related to themselves. This effect stems from the idea that people place greater importance on, and therefore pay more attention to, information that they perceive as closely connected to their own lives, experiences, or self-concept. This heightened attention and personal connection make the information more memorable. The self-relevance effect is significant in various fields, such as marketing and psychology, for understanding how personal relevance influences memory and decision-making processes.

\#\#\#\# Negativity bias

Negativity bias is a psychological phenomenon where negative events, emotions, or information have a greater effect on an individual's psychological state and processes than neutral or positive things. This bias means that people are more likely to focus on, remember, and be influenced by negative experiences rather than positive or neutral ones. It is thought to have evolutionary origins, as paying more attention to negative or dangerous stimuli could have been crucial for survival. Negativity bias affects various aspects of human behavior and decision-making, from personal relationships to professional settings.

\#\#\# We notice when something has changed

\#\#\#\# Anchoring bias

Anchoring bias is a cognitive bias where an individual relies too heavily on an initial piece of information (the "anchor") when making decisions. Once an anchor is set, subsequent judgments are made by adjusting away from that anchor, and there is a bias toward interpreting other information around the anchor. This effect occurs in various decision-making processes, including financial estimates and negotiations, where the initial price or value serves as an anchor that influences subsequent decisions and evaluations.

\#\#\#\# Conservatism bias

Conservatism bias is a cognitive tendency where individuals are slow to update their beliefs when faced with new information. This bias can manifest in different contexts, resulting in overreaction or underreaction to changes in circumstances. In financial markets, for example, conservatism bias may cause traders to adjust their beliefs about asset values more slowly than expected, potentially leading to price anomalies. However, this bias is not exclusive to financial decision-making; it is part of a broader set of cognitive biases that affect human judgments across various domains. The phenomenon has been linked to the way individuals process information in memory-based decision-making, where noisy or incomplete information can contribute to slower belief updates. Additionally, some researchers suggest that conservatism bias may be interconnected with other cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias and the tendency to react differently to positive versus negative information.

\#\#\#\# Contrast effect

Contrast effects, also known as contrast bias, refer to a psychological pattern where the perception of a current situation is influenced inversely by a previously observed event. This bias can manifest in various contexts, affecting how individuals evaluate new information based on what they have just experienced. For instance, a positive experience can make subsequent events seem less impressive, while a negative experience can enhance the perceived value of what follows. Contrast effects play a role in decision-making processes across different areas, from financial judgments to social interactions, and can even influence risk-taking behavior. This tendency illustrates the human inclination to compare and evaluate new stimuli relative to recent experiences, shaping responses and choices in ways that may not always align with objective assessments.

\#\#\#\# Distinction bias

Distinction bias is a psychological tendency where individuals overestimate the differences in outcomes when evaluating options side-by-side (joint evaluation) compared to considering them separately (single evaluation). This bias primarily affects options that differ quantitatively rather than qualitatively. It influences various decision-making contexts, such as how people react to policies or interpret data visualizations. For example, individuals may show a preference for certain strategies or options when they compare them simultaneously rather than in isolation. While distinction bias has been observed in diverse fields, recent research shows mixed results, indicating that its effects may vary depending on context or specific conditions. This bias reflects a common human tendency to perceive differences more sharply when options are directly compared.

\#\#\#\# Focusing effect

The focusing effect, also known as attentional bias, is a psychological tendency where individuals give disproportionate attention to specific aspects of an event or issue, which can influence their judgments and decisions. This bias can manifest in a variety of ways, such as narrowing focus on certain details while ignoring broader contexts. It affects decision-making in multiple domains, including social interactions, negotiations, and problem-solving. For example, during negotiations, individuals might focus too heavily on particular issues, leading to less efficient outcomes. This tendency reflects a natural inclination to concentrate on prominent features of a situation, often at the expense of considering all relevant factors.

\#\#\#\# Framing effect

The framing effect is a cognitive bias where individuals' decisions and judgments are influenced by how information is presented, rather than just the information itself. This bias can manifest in various forms, such as differences in perception based on whether choices are framed in terms of gains or losses, specific attributes, or goals. The framing effect challenges the idea of consistent decision-making, illustrating how people may react differently to the same problem depending on its presentation. Factors like loss aversion and social cues play a role in this bias, reflecting a common human tendency to be swayed by the context and framing of information in various situations, including economic decisions, pricing strategies, and negotiations.

\#\#\#\# Money illusion

Money illusion is a cognitive bias where individuals focus on the nominal value of money rather than its real purchasing power, affecting their economic decisions. This bias can manifest in various ways, such as perceiving changes in wages or prices without accounting for inflation or deflation. It can lead to "sticky" prices in markets, mispricing of assets, and distorted financial choices. The influence of money illusion varies among individuals, with those who are more financially literate being less susceptible. This tendency illustrates a natural inclination to think in terms of face value, which can have significant implications for consumer behavior, market dynamics, and responses to economic changes.

\#\#\#\# Weber-Fechner law

The Weber-Fechner Law is a cognitive tendency describing how humans perceive changes in the intensity of physical stimuli in a logarithmic manner. This law suggests that the perceived change in a stimulus is proportional to the logarithm of the actual change, meaning that as the stimulus increases, larger changes are required to be noticeable. Initially observed in human sensory systems, this phenomenon has been found to extend to various domains, including assessments of quality in communication scenarios. While its application varies across different senses, the Weber-Fechner Law reflects a natural human inclination to perceive changes in a way that depends on relative, rather than absolute, differences. This tendency has also influenced practical applications in fields like machine learning, where it has been used to improve the learning of complex human concepts.

\#\#\# We are drawn to details that confirm Our Own existing beliefs

\#\#\#\# Confirmation bias

Confirmation bias is a cognitive pattern where individuals tend to seek out, interpret, and remember information that supports their preexisting beliefs while ignoring or dismissing evidence that contradicts them. This bias can manifest in various ways, influencing decision-making and judgments in fields such as software development, research, and design. It is particularly pronounced when dealing with emotionally charged topics or deeply held beliefs. This tendency can lead to issues like belief perseverance, attitude polarization, and the formation of illusory correlations. Recognizing confirmation bias is essential in promoting balanced decision-making and avoiding misleading conclusions across different domains.

\#\#\#\# Congruence bias

Congruence bias is a cognitive tendency where individuals favor information that aligns with their preexisting beliefs or expectations. This bias can manifest in various ways, such as perceiving objects in the same location as identical, even when evidence suggests otherwise. It also extends to emotional states, influencing how people estimate the likelihood of future events, with different emotions like sadness and anger affecting judgments in distinct ways. In decision-making, congruence bias can lead to the overvaluation of information that confirms the most likely hypothesis. This tendency reflects a natural inclination to seek out and prioritize information that aligns with one's current beliefs or emotional states.

\#\#\#\# Post-purchase rationalization

Post-purchase rationalization is a cognitive tendency where individuals justify their purchasing decisions after the fact. This bias can manifest in various ways, such as evaluating a product more positively to align with the choice made, even if it does not fully meet initial expectations or needs. It often involves rationalizing impulsive purchases or using neutralization techniques to reduce cognitive dissonance caused by the inconsistency between attitudes and behaviors. This tendency reflects a natural inclination to feel rational and satisfied with one's decisions, leading to an inflated sense of product satisfaction shortly after the purchase.

\#\#\#\# Choice-supportive bias

Choice-supportive bias is a psychological tendency where individuals view their past decisions more positively, often overlooking or downplaying any contradictory evidence. This bias can manifest in various contexts, such as evaluating past viewing experiences, scientific research findings, or corporate decision-making outcomes. For instance, individuals may justify decisions made in the past, like hiring a CEO or selecting a research methodology, by focusing on positive aspects while ignoring shortcomings. This tendency reflects a natural inclination to perceive one's choices as favorable, reinforcing the sense of rationality and consistency in decision-making.

\#\#\#\# Selective perception

Selective perception is a cognitive tendency where individuals focus on specific aspects of information while ignoring others, influenced by their personal experiences, beliefs, attitudes, and even biological factors. This bias can manifest in various contexts, such as interpreting events, making decisions, or analyzing data. It reflects a natural inclination to perceive information in a way that aligns with one’s existing viewpoints or priorities. Selective perception can shape how people interpret information, sometimes reinforcing their beliefs or leading to narrow problem-solving approaches, even in situations where a broader perspective might be beneficial.

\#\#\#\# Observer-expectancy effect

The observer-expectancy effect, also known as expectancy bias, is a cognitive phenomenon where an observer's expectations or biases influence their perception and interpretation of events or data. This bias can manifest in various settings, such as evaluating performances, interpreting scientific results, or conducting observations in behavioral studies. It reflects a natural tendency for observers to see what they expect to see, often leading to skewed interpretations that align with their pre-existing beliefs. The observer-expectancy effect highlights the importance of awareness and mitigation strategies in research and decision-making processes to ensure objectivity and accuracy.

\#\#\#\# Experimenter’s bias

Experimenter’s bias is a cognitive tendency where researchers unintentionally influence the outcomes of a study to align with their expectations or hypotheses. This bias can manifest in various ways, such as through subtle visual or verbal cues directed at participants or the influence of the experimenter’s characteristics, like gender, on the results. It reflects a natural inclination to see what one expects, often affecting the objectivity of scientific investigations. Recognizing and mitigating experimenter’s bias is crucial in research design to ensure more accurate and unbiased findings.

\#\#\#\# Observer effect

The observer effect is a phenomenon where the act of observation itself alters the behavior or outcome of what is being observed. This effect can manifest in various contexts, such as influencing performance measurements in computer systems, altering user behavior on social media, or affecting the nature of research through editorial decisions. It reflects a natural tendency for the presence of an observer to impact the subject of observation, leading to changes that might not occur otherwise. Recognizing and addressing the observer effect is essential across different fields to ensure more accurate data collection and interpretation.

\#\#\#\# Expectation bias

Expectation bias is a psychological tendency where an individual's expectations influence their perceptions of outcomes or behaviors. This bias can manifest in various contexts, such as clinical trials, where both raters and subjects may unconsciously skew results based on what they anticipate happening. It also plays a role in social interactions, where people may expect negative feedback and, as a result, remember social evaluations more negatively. Expectation bias reflects a natural inclination to perceive events in a way that aligns with preexisting beliefs or anticipations, potentially leading to skewed interpretations and conclusions.

\#\#\#\# Ostrich effect

The Ostrich Effect is a psychological tendency where individuals selectively seek positive information while avoiding negative information. This bias can manifest in various ways, particularly in financial contexts, where people may prefer to acquire information about potential gains rather than losses. For example, investors might avoid checking their portfolios during market declines or managers might focus on performance data when they expect positive outcomes. This tendency reflects a natural inclination to avoid discomfort or anxiety associated with negative information, potentially leading to less rational decision-making in uncertain situations.

\#\#\#\# Subjective validation

Subjective validation is a cognitive tendency where individuals assess the validity of information or measures based on their personal beliefs, experiences, or preferences. This bias can manifest in various fields, such as research and psychometrics, where subjective measures are used to gauge outcomes like company performance or well-being. Despite its potential usefulness, subjective validation may lead to overreliance on personal judgments, highlighting the importance of using objective validation techniques to support more accurate evaluations. This tendency reflects a natural inclination to trust one's own assessments and perspectives when interpreting information or results.

\#\#\#\# Continued influence effect

The continued influence effect (CIE) is a cognitive tendency where misinformation continues to impact reasoning and decision-making, even after it has been corrected or retracted. This bias can manifest in various contexts, as individuals may still rely on the incorrect information when forming judgments or explanations. The effect is influenced by factors such as the credibility of the source, with trustworthiness playing a key role in the success of retractions. CIE reflects a natural inclination to hold onto initial information, especially when it provides a coherent causal explanation, highlighting the complexities involved in updating beliefs and mitigating the effects of misinformation.

\#\#\#\# Semmelweis reflex

The Semmelweis reflex is a psychological tendency to reject new information that contradicts established beliefs or norms. This bias can manifest in various contexts, such as dismissing innovative ideas, research findings, or practices that challenge conventional thinking. It reflects a natural inclination to cling to familiar beliefs and resist change, even when presented with evidence. The Semmelweis reflex highlights the challenges of embracing new information and the importance of openness in advancing knowledge and improving practices across different fields.

\#\#\# We notice flaws in others more easily than than we notice flaws in ourselves

\#\#\#\# Bias blind spot

The bias blind spot is a psychological tendency where individuals perceive themselves as less susceptible to biases than others. This bias can manifest in various contexts, with people often recognizing biases in others' judgments but struggling to identify them in their own. Interestingly, this effect persists regardless of cognitive ability, as those with higher cognitive skills may actually exhibit a larger bias blind spot. It reflects a natural inclination to believe in one's objectivity, influencing judgment and behavior, and highlighting the challenge of self-awareness in understanding one's own cognitive biases.

\#\#\#\# Naive cynicism

Naive cynicism is a psychological tendency where individuals expect others to be more biased or self-interested than they actually are. This bias can manifest in various contexts, such as assessing responsibility, negotiating, or engaging in policy debates. It reflects a natural inclination to attribute others' actions to personal motives, often leading to the dismissal of situational factors or alternative explanations. Naive cynicism influences how people perceive and interact with others, sometimes creating barriers to understanding and cooperation in competitive or collaborative situations.

\#\#\#\# Naive realism

Naive realism is a psychological tendency where individuals believe that they perceive the world exactly as it is, without recognizing the influence of subjective interpretation or cognitive biases. This bias can manifest in various contexts, such as perception, belief formation, and even design. It reflects a natural inclination to trust one's direct experiences and perceptions as objective reality, often overlooking the complexity of human perception and the potential for flawed or imprecise interpretations. Naive realism can lead to misunderstandings and disagreements, especially when individuals assume their perspective is the only accurate view of reality.
